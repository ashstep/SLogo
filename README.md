## Assignment comments:

Assigning a 4-person team to a project with 4 APIs and encouraging this 1-person-each-API work
division was rather unfair for this project. Command parsing is so much more difficult than the rest of the
work, especially compared to the UI, and so our command parsing person had to work much harder and longer, and was not able to
implement many extensions. We could not help her debug effectively because we did not write the parsing logic
with her. I would recommend warning groups before the project starts that this section is the most difficult
by far, so people split up work accordingly.
